## Implementation
This implementation uses **Python 3** (with Pandas, Scikit-learn and SciPy modules) and TensorFlow 1.12. CAGE modules were implemented using TF [Estimators](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/estimators) and [Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets).

The CAGE modules training and evaluation can be performed either locally (GPU highly recommended) or using [Google Cloud Platform ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/) managed service.

## Dataset for reproducibility
The experiments reported in the papers [1] use the following datasets:
- [Adressa dataset](http://reclab.idi.ntnu.no/dataset/) - This dataset contains approximately 20 million page visits from a Norwegian news portal. In our experiments we used 16 days of the full dataset, which is available upon request, and includes article text and click events of about 2 million users and 13,000 articles.
- [MIcrosoft News Dataset](https://msnews.github.io/) - MIND contains about 160k English news articles and more than 15 million impression logs generated by 1 million users. Every news article contains rich textual content including title, abstract, body, category and entities.

## Article Content Representation (ACR) module
The *ACR* module is responsible to extract features from news articles text and metadata and to learn a distributed representations (embeddings) for each news article context.

The *ACR* module learns an *Article Content Embedding* for each article independently from the recorded user sessions. This is done for scalability reasons, because training user interactions and articles in a joint process would be computationally very expensive, given the typically large amount of daily user interactions in a typical news portal. Instead, the internal model is trained for a side classification task (e.g. predicting target metadata attributes of an article).

The input for the *ACR *module is the article textual content, represented as a sequence of word embeddings (e.g., word2vec, GLoVE). 

The *ACR module* is composed of two sub-modules: *Textual Features Representation (TFR)* and *Content Embeddings Training (CET)*. The *TFR* sub-module is responsible to learn relevant features directly from the article textual content, and can be instantiated using CNN and RNNs, for example. 

The *CET* sub-module is responsible to train the *Article Content Embeddings (ACE)* for a side task. It can be instantiated as a *supervised* or *unsupervised* learning model. In the *supervised approach*, the side task is to predict articles' metadata attributes, such as articles categories. In the *unsupervised approach*, the task is to reconstruct the original article text from the learned *ACE*, as an sequence autoencoder.

After training, the *Article Content Embeddings* for news articles (NumPy matrix) are persisted into a Pickle dump file, for further usage by *NAR* module.

### Important notes about experiments with the ACR module

#### Globo.com dataset

**It was not possible to share the articles' textual content for [Globo.com dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/news-portal-user-interactions-by-globocom) due to licensing reasons. Although, it is not necessary to run the ACR module pre-processing and training commands (presented in the following subsections), since the trained Article Content Embeddings (*articles_embeddings.pickle*) and Article Metadata (*articles_metadata.csv*) were already been provided with the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gspmoreira/news-portal-user-interactions-by-globocom).**

#### Adressa dataset

The creators of the [Adressa dataset](http://reclab.idi.ntnu.no/dataset) can make available the full textual content of articles upon request. After download their data, you must follow this steps:

1. As Adressa has provided a large dataset, the first pre-processing step is performed using Spark. 
	1. Create a Spark cluster ([dataproc_preprocessing/create_cluster.sh]()) on GCP Dataproc
	2. Open a Jupyter session ([dataproc_preprocessing/browse_cluster.sh]())
	3. Upload the preprocessing notebook ([dataproc_preprocessing/nar_preprocessing_addressa_01_dataproc.ipynb]()), adjust the GCS path where the Adressa dataset was uploaded and run the notebook. 
	4. Download the sessions JSON lines and the pickle with nar_encoders_dict, exported by the notebook, to be used by the 2nd step of pre-processing
	5. Destroy the Spark cluster ([dataproc_preprocessing/destroy_cluster.sh]())

2. Run the 2nd pre-processing step ([run_acr_preprocessing_adressa.sh]()) 
3. Run the training and evaluation script ([run_acr_training_adressa_local.sh]()), to generate the Article Content Embeddings with the ACR module. 


### Pre-processing data for the ACR module
Here is an example of the command to pre-process articles text and metadata for the *ACR* module for **Adressa dataset**.
P.s. Again, you will not be able to run the corresponding pre-processing script for the **G1 dataset**, as described in the previous section.

It allows to specify the path of a CSV containing articles text and metadata (*input_articles_csv_path*), the path of pre-trained word embeddings and exports articles data into TFRecords format into *output_tf_records_path*, including the dictionaries that mapped tokenized words to sequences of int (*output_word_vocab_embeddings_path*) and metadata the categorical features encoders (*output_label_encoders*). 

The word embeddings (*input_word_embeddings_path* parameter) must be in [Gensim format](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html), either in binary or plain text format. For Globo.com dataset, we used pre-trained Portuguese word embeddings (skip-gram model (300 dimensions), available [here](http://nilc.icmc.usp.br/embeddings) and for Adressa dataset we used Norwegian word-embeddings (skip-gram model with 100 dimen-
sions (model #100), available [here](http://vectors.nlpl.eu/repository)).

```bash
#!/bin/bash

```

### Training ACR module
The ACR module can be trained either **locally** (example below) or using **GCP ML Engine** ([run_acr_training_gcom_mlengine.sh]()).

The path of pre-processed TFRecords is informed in *train_set_path_regex* parameter, as well as the other *ACR* exported assets (*input_word_vocab_embeddings_path* and *input_label_encoders_path*). The trained *Article Content Embeddings* (NumPy matrix), with the dimensions specified by *acr_embeddings_size*, are exported (Pickle dump file) after training to *output_acr_metadata_embeddings_path*, for further usage by the *NAR* module.

You can train using an *supervised* or *unsupervised* instantiation of the *ACR* module by changing the --training_task parameter ("metadata_classification" or "autoencoder") and change the feature extraction using the --text_feature_extractor parameter ("CNN", "GRU").

```bash
DATA_DIR="[REPLACE BY THE ADRESSA ARTICLES DATASET PATH]" && \
JOB_PREFIX=adressa && \
JOB_ID=`whoami`_${JOB_PREFIX}_`date '+%Y_%m_%d_%H%M%S'` && \

## Next-Article Recommendation (NAR) module

The *Next-Article Recommendation (NAR)* module is responsible for providing news articles recommendations for active sessions.
Due to the high sparsity of users and their constant interests shift, these CHAMELEON instantiations leverages only session-based contextual information, ignoring possible usersâ€™ past sessions.

The inputs for the *NAR* module are: (1) the pre-trained *Article Content Embedding* of the last viewed article; (2) the contextual properties of the articles (recent popularity and recency); and (3) the user context (e.g. time, location, and device). These inputs are combined by Fully Connected layers to produce a *User-Personalized Contextual Article Embedding*, whose representations might differ for the same article, depending on the user context and on the current article context (popularity and recency).

These *NAR* module instantiations uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to model the sequence of articles read by users in their sessions, represented by their *User-Personalized Contextual Article Embeddings*. For each article of the sequence, the RNN outputs a *Predicted Next-Article Embedding* â€“ the expected representation of a news content the user would like to read next in the active session.

The *NAR* module is composed by three sub-modules: *Contextual Article Representation (CAR)*, *SEssion Representation (SER)*, and *Recommendations Ranking (RR)*. You can find more details about those sub-modules in [3].

In most deep learning architectures proposed for RS, the neural network outputs a vector whose dimension is the number of available items. Such approach may work for domains were the items number is more stable, like movies and books. Although, in the dynamic scenario of news recommendations, where thousands of news stories are added and removed daily, such approach could require full retrain of the network, as often as new articles are published.  

For this reason, instead of using a softmax cross-entropy loss, the NAR module is trained to maximize the similarity between the *Predicted Next-Article Embedding* and the *User-Personalized Contextual Article Embedding* corresponding to the next article actually read by the user in his session (positive sample), whilst minimizing its similarity with negative samples (articles not read by the user during the session). With this strategy to deal with item cold-start, a newly published article might be immediately recommended, as soon as its *Article Content Embedding* is trained and added to a repository.

The following example commands are for the Globo.com dataset. For the Adressa dataset, you want to use [run_nar_preprocessing_adressa.sh]() for pre-processing and [run_nar_train_adressa_local.sh]() for training and evaluation.

### Pre-processing data for the NAR module
The NAR module expects TFRecord files containing [SequenceExamples](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train/SequenceExample) of user sessions's context and clicked articles.

The following example command ([run_nar_preprocessing_adressa.sh]()) takes the path of CSV files, containing users sessions split by hour (*input_clicks_csv_path_regex*), and outputs the corresponding TFRecord files.

```bash
cd nar_module && \
DATA_DIR="[REPLACE WITH THE PATH TO UNZIPPED ADRESSA DATASET FOLDER]" && \

#Testing pre-processing with new contextual features
python3 -m nar.preprocessing.nar_preprocess_adressa \
	--input_sessions_json_folder_path ${DATA_DIR}/sessions_processed_by_spark \
	--input_acr_metadata_embeddings_path ${DATA_DIR}/pickles/acr_articles_metadata_embeddings.pickle \
	--input_nar_encoders_dict_path ${DATA_DIR}/pickles/nar_encoders_adressa.pickle \
	--number_hours_to_preprocess 384 \
 	--output_nar_preprocessing_resources_path ${DATA_DIR}/pickles/nar_preprocessing_resources.pickle \
 	--output_sessions_tfrecords_path "${DATA_DIR}/sessions_tfrecords_by_hour/adressa_sessions_hour_*.tfrecord.gz"
```

### Training and evaluating the NAR module
The *NAR* module is trained and evaluated according to the following *Temporal Offline Evaluation Method*, described in [2]:
1. Train the NAR module with sessions within the active hour.
2. Evaluate the NAR module with sessions within the next hour, for the task of the next-click prediction.

The following baseline methods (described in more detail in [4]) are also trained and evaluated in parallel, as benchmarks for CHAMELEON:
- **Neural methods**: **GRU4Rec**, **SR-GNN**
- **Association Rules-based methods**: **Co-occurrent (CO)**, **Sequential Rules (SR)**
- **Neighborhood-based methods**: **Item-kNN**, **Vector Multiplication Session-Based kNN (V-SkNN)**
- **Other methods**: **Recently Popular (RP)**, **Content-Based (CB)**

The choosen evaluation metrics were **Hit-Rate@N** and **MRR@N** for accuracy, **COV** for catalog coverage, **ESI-R** and **ESI-RR** for novelty, and **EILD-R** and **EILD-RR** for diversity, described in [4].

#### Parameters
The *train_set_path_regex* parameter expects the path (local or GCS) where the sessions' TFRecords were exported. It also expects the path of the articles metadata CSV (*acr_module_articles_metadata_csv_path*) and the Pickle dump file with the *Article Content Embeddings* (*acr_module_articles_content_embeddings_pickle_path*).

It is necessary to specify a subset of files (representing sessions started in the same hour) for training and evaluation (*train_files_from* to *train_files_up_to*). The frequency of evaluation is specified in *training_hours_for_each_eval* (e.g. *training_hours_for_each_eval=5* means that after training on 5 hour's (files) sessions, the next hour (file) is used for evaluation. 

To reproduce the experiments of [3] (**only for the *Adressa dataset*, as the articles text for the *G1 dataset* could not be provided**), where different techniques of content representation are compared, you can generate the *ACEs* using the *ACR* supervised implementations using "acr_module/scripts/run_acr_training_\*_classification.sh" (CNN or GRU) and the unsupervised implementation using "run_acr_training_\*_autoencoder.sh". The files to generate the *ACEs* using baseline techniques reported in the paper (LSA, doc2vec, W2V*TF-IDF) are available at "acr_module/acr/preprocessing/". After generating the *ACE* (numpy array dumped using Pickle), you can test them with the *NAR* module to evaluate the effect of that content representation in the recommendation quality, setting the path of the Pickle file using the "--acr_module_resources_path" hyperparamenter.

To reproduce the experiments of [4], where additional features are used as inputs to the NAR module, you must change the following parameters according to the Input Configurations (IC) reported in the paper: *enabled_articles_input_features_groups*, *enabled_clicks_input_features_groups*, *enabled_internal_features*.

To reproduce the experiments reported in [4] with the novelty regularization in loss function, change the parameter *novelty_reg_factor*.

The *disable_eval_benchmarks* parameter disables training and evaluation of benchmark methods (useful for speed up). 

The *NAR* module can either be trained locally or using GCP ML Engine, as following examples.  

#### Local training and evaluation of NAR module

#### ML Engine training and evaluation of NAR module
When training the *NAR* module in GCP ML Engine, two parameters are specially important:
- *use_local_cache_model_dir* - TensorFlow logs and summaries are usually large and saving them directly to GCS considerally slows down the training/evaluation process. When this parameter is present, TF model logs to a local folder in the worker machine.
- *save_results_each_n_evals* - The frequency (number of evaluation loops) in which TF logs saved locally are uploaded to a GCS path (*model_dir*).

P.s. As the proposed *Temporal Offline Evaluation Method* assumes that hours are trained and evaluated in sequence, a single ML Engine worker with GPU is used (*scale-tier=basic-gpu*) to avoid leaking from future sessions (due to the asynchronous training when more than one worker is used).

abstract = { Online news recommender systems aim to make personalized recommendations according to user preferences, which require modeling usersâ€™ short-term reading interest. However, due to the limited logged user interactions in practice, news recommendation at session-level becomes very challenging. Existing methods on session-based news recommendation mainly focus on extracting features from news articles and sequential user-item interactions, but they usually ignore the semantic-level structural information among news articles and do not explore external knowledge sources. In this paper, we propose a novel Context-Aware Graph Embedding (CAGE) framework for session-based news recommendation, which builds an auxiliary knowledge graph to enrich the semantic meaning of entities involved in articles, and further refines the article embeddings by graph convolutional networks. Experimental results on a real-world news dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with the state-of-the-art methods on session-based news recommendation.},
